Hi friend,

I'm hoping you can briefly help me with a school project. You could help me in one of two ways.

I'm looking for a half-dozen collaborators who have time to spend a half hour on a video call with me in the next few days to answer some questions about an idea I have for an art project. The call will be recorded and used in a project posted on youtube and shared with my class.

If you can't, or would not like to, you could still help me, by responding today to this message with a short (10 seconds) explaining very briefly your reason for declining. "Hi, sorry! Too busy with work!" "No way, I hate meetings". " Fat chance james, you owe me money." 

Parts of these recordings will also be used in a class project, but only the contents of the video would be shared. So, for example If you arent participating because you are concerned about privacy, the video doesn't need to show your face, or could even just be a 10 second video of dinner cooking or a handwritten note.

If you choose to participate by declining, You can just record the video on your phone and text or email it to me, at 206.659.5892 or jms@wtkns.com. Or post it somewhere and share a link by text at 206.659.5892 or email @ jms@wtkns.com.

If you want to participate in the longer video call, send me an email or text today and I'll be in touch to schedule an appointment and give you a link and some details.

If you can't help out, no worries, I hope you are happy and well and thanks for your time!
