## Summary:

Location-based, participatory, relational artwork, inspired by Fluxus "event scores", anchored in the physical environment, and mediated digitally. Fflux.us uses the motivational mechanisms of social media to direct participants' attention into mindful awareness of their present circumstances, playful engagement with their environment, and reflection on the way their experience may relate to others who share the same physical space, but who are separated by time.

## Description:

In a public space, the participant ("Viewer") encounters a brightly colored vinyl sticker with a QR code. Scanning the code opens a minimal website displaying only a video player. The video is a recording of another participant ("Director") in the same physical location as the viewer, thanking them for participating in an artwork and asking them to further collaborate (becoming a "Performer") by recording a short video on their device and uploading it for others.

The director offers a simple ["score"](https://www.thing.net/~grist/ld/fluxusworkbook.pdf), an instructional prompt (see examples below), for a brief (1-3 min.) video that relates to the specifics of the location and is intended to elicit a performer's individual action and relational reflection, highlighting the commonalities and differences of each performer's individual experience of the same space and their unique interpretation of the same score.

After the viewer watches the instructions they choose whether to become a performer by tapping a button that activates their video camera and uploads their video. If the viewer declines to participate by uploading a video, their visit is logged, but no further interaction is offered. Once a viewer uploads a video file and becomes a performer they can view the videos left by previous performers in the same location, responding to the same director's score. Even outlier "performances" from performers who don't follow the prompt or who upload a blank recording provide interesting content for reflection.

If the performer wishes to participate further after watching the videos, they can become a director by submitting their mailing address. They will receive a package containing a brightly colored vinyl sticker with a unique QR code, and instructions on how to record their own score and simple suggestions on creating a score which is aligned with the purpose of the work. The director chooses a location, records a new set of instructions, and the cycle continues. 

After activating their own score, directors may become "organizing artists" by participating in physical or virtual meet-ups to collaborate on maintaining and guiding the project.

## Examples:
* Near a dog park: "Please record a 60 second video introducing your dog. If you don't have a dog, pretend."
* Near a work of public art: "Ask a friend to record a short video of you dancing with the statue. Ask them to provide the music."
* In a coffee shop condiment counter: "Please record a 60 second video demonstrating how you prepare your tea or coffee."
* On a rocky beach: "Can you skip stones? Please record a 60 second video demonstrating your technique to teach others or documenting your failure."
* On a blue Postal Collection Box: "I mailed my marriage certificate here. What are you mailing today? Use today's mail to record a video reenactment of sending the most important thing you've ever mailed." 
* Near a stencil graffiti of a trophy: "please accept this prestigious award. Now record a video of yourself giving a thank you speech. Be sure to tell us what you are receiving the award for."
